<h1>Special Day</h1>
<hr>

<p>Happy birthday, Chen. I am fortunate to have met you in life. you're always there when I'm sad or happy. With you my day is always bright and I can share my thoughts and dreams. A girl that I know who is cheerful, friendly, and fun. I love how comfortable your presence makes me feel and how reliable your support is ! On your special day I want to know that you are really special and I'm lucky to have u as my friend. </p>

<p>I know getting older isn't easy, sometimes the things of life can really suck. And maybe you're starting to experience it now. But what I want you to know is that you can get through it and you have the capabilities. Don't be too hard on yourself, take a break when you feel exhausted, and you always have me as a friend to vent all your feelings.</p>

<p>Last but not least, I hope all your wishes become true. Even it's just funny things like getting Raiden Shogun or getting radiant in Valorant. Or even your big dreams like your life goals and your future plan. I'm rooting on u, Chen ! </p>
